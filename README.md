Hello,

I have successfully completed the Developer Jokes homework assigned in the Android Mobile Application Course: Kotlin & Java taught by Mr. Atıl Samancıoğlu. During this process, I accomplished the following in stages:

✅ Jetpack Compose with MVVM Architecture: Developed a developer jokes application based on the MVVM architecture using Jetpack Compose.

✅ Data Management with Sealed Class Structures: Learned how to handle different types of jokes (one-part and two-part) from the API by processing them with sealed classes and converting them into appropriate models.

✅ Fetching Data from an API (Retrofit): Defined an API service using Retrofit to fetch data from the jokes.json file.

✅ Managing Data Flow with StateFlow: While retrieving data with Retrofit, I used StateFlow to transfer the data from the ViewModel to the UI.

✅ Listing with LazyColumn: Displayed the list of jokes on the screen using LazyColumn, with a JokeRow function for each joke.

✅ Separation of Business and UI Logic: Achieved a cleaner architecture by separating business logic and UI logic through the ViewModel in MainActivity.

While completing this assignment, I had the opportunity to review the lessons from previous courses, and I also enhanced my skills by learning new functionalities that I hadn't encountered before.

I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Atıl Samancıoğlu for this valuable training.
